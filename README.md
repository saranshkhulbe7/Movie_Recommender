# Movie Recommender
This Project shows how to make a movie recommender for all the movie buffs out there, and how to take some movie names from user and give them different movies based on the input of that user. In this project we are going to give them names of movies based on the the same genre as the movies as inputted by the user. 

All we have to do is to give name of the similar movies you would like to watch in the program, and follow the instructions we'll get during run time!
